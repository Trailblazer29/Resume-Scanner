# Resume-Scanner

This Resume Scanner assesses the similarity between applicants' resumes and job descriptions, regardless of their formats (DOCX, PDF, TXT, JPG, PNG), to serve as an ATS (Applicant Tracking System). It can be used by recruiters to filter applicants' resumes for faster and more efficient selections of relevant resumes and ideal applicant profiles.
